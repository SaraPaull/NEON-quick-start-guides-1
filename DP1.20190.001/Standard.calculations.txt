Standard calculations for determining reaeration rates from the published data can be found in the Appendix (6.3) of the NEON User Guide to Reaeration and Salt-based Discharge Sampling. The NEON-developed R package reaRate can also be used to calculate loss rate, travel times, and k600 values from the data (https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-reaeration). The def.format.reaeration.R function in the reaRate package is especially helpful for joining relevant tables depending on the injectionType used for experiments.
