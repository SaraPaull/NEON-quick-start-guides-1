Standard calculations for determining salt-based discharge can be found in the Appendix (6.1, 6.2) of the NEON User Guide to Reaeration and Salt-based Discharge Sampling. The NEON-developed R package streamQ can also be used to calculate salt-based stream discharge (https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-stream-discharge). The def.format.Q.R function in the streamQ package is especially helpful for joining relevant tables depending on the injectionType used for experiments.
